FAQS:

- How many locations can a user have?
  - Do we want to allow them to add as many as they want or a specific number?
    - If its a specific number, do what is it and would it be more efficient to
      save those locations in a variable or an array?

- Do we want the user to be allowed to change the notification radius?
   - If so, what is the min and max radius?

- For the weather forecast screen, how many locations of weathers do we want them to see?
  - Can they search the location and get the weather of it or just show the forecast of the
    the ones they saved from the google maps?

- Do we want to add a unique load screen when we start the app?
